# Simulation Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the agent-based simulation model for a construction project environment, updated with stochastic Situational Awareness (SA) updates, a dependent variable defined as **SA_Level** (Delta_SA, the change in Average_SA from Step 0 to Step 100), and explicit documentation of independent, dependent, and mediating variables. The codebase includes `main.py`, `construction_model.py`, `construction_agent.py`, `analyse_h1.py`, `data_classes.py`, `decision_model.py`, and `enums.py`. Below, we detail the hypothesis with variable definitions, information flows, agent decision-making, stochasticity, decision flows, organizational structure impacts, updated simulation results, and an analysis of robustness and variance.

## Hypothesis Tested

**H1: A dedicated reporting structure results in a higher SA_Level (change in Average Situational Awareness from Step 0 to Step 100) than self or none reporting structures in a functional organizational structure.**

- **Context**: The simulation evaluates whether a dedicated reporting structure, with Reporter agents aggregating and disseminating information, leads to a greater increase in Average_SA over the simulation compared to self or none reporting structures. The hypothesis is tested using one-way ANOVA on SA_Level in `analyse_h1.py`.
- **Variables**:
  - **Independent Variable**: Reporting Structure (`dedicated`, `self`, `none`), defined in `enums.py` and implemented in `construction_model.py`. The reporting structure determines how agents communicate events (e.g., dedicated uses Reporters for aggregation, self uses hierarchical reporting, none uses broadcasting with higher failure rates).
  - **Dependent Variable**: SA_Level (Delta_SA), calculated as the change in Average_SA from Step 0 to Step 100 per run. Average_SA is the mean of SA scores (Worker_SA, Manager_SA, Director_SA, Reporter_SA) from the `SituationalAwareness` class in `data_classes.py`, averaging perception, comprehension, and projection components.
  - **Mediating Variables**:
    - **Agent Role**: Roles (Worker, Manager, Director, Reporter) mediate the effect of reporting structure on SA_Level by influencing detection accuracy (0.80–0.95), reporting probability (0.80–0.95), and communication patterns (e.g., Reporters’ aggregation in dedicated structures).
    - **Communication Effectiveness**: Determined by communication radius (3 for functional), failure probability (0.05 for dedicated/self, 0.10 for none), and modifiers (e.g., 1.3x failure increase for safety incidents >5). Effective communication enhances SA updates, impacting SA_Level.
    - **Event Detection and Reporting**: The frequency and accuracy of event detection (via `observe_event` in `construction_agent.py`) and reporting (via `send_report`) mediate SA_Level by driving SA updates. Stochastic elements (e.g., random detection checks) influence this process.
- **Analysis**: ANOVA tests for significant differences in SA_Level across reporting structures, followed by Tukey HSD post-hoc tests. Effect size (Cohen's f) and power analysis assess robustness.

## Information Flows

Information flows, implemented in `construction_model.py` (`send_report`) and `construction_agent.py` (`observe_event`, `send_report`), are governed by the independent variable (reporting structure) and organizational structure (`functional`, `flat`, `hierarchical`).

- **Dedicated**: Non-Reporters send reports to Reporters within a communication radius (5 for flat, 3 for functional, 2 for hierarchical). In functional structures, hierarchical reporting (Workers to Managers, Managers to Directors, Directors to Managers) occurs. Reporters aggregate reports by maximum severity and broadcast to non-Reporters. Communication failure probability is 0.05.
- **Self**: Hierarchical reporting in functional structures or to Managers/Directors in non-functional structures, with 0.05 failure probability.
- **None**: Broadcast to relevant roles, with hierarchical reporting in functional structures and 0.10 failure probability.
- **Modifiers**: Flat structures reduce failure by 0.8x; hierarchical increase it by 1.2x. Safety incidents (>5) increase failure by 1.3x. Dedicated reports amplify severity by 1.1x.

## Agent Decision-Making by Role

Agents (`construction_agent.py`) have roles (`Worker`, `Manager`, `Director`, `Reporter`) from `enums.py`, mediating the effect of reporting structure on SA_Level through detection and reporting behaviors, influenced by the `DecisionModel` in `decision_model.py`.

- **Worker**: Detection accuracy 0.80, reporting probability 0.80. Always `ACT` on hazards unless follow-up; otherwise, use `DecisionModel` (bias to `ACT`, 0.8 probability). Hazard actions trigger safety incidents; delay actions increment tasks.
- **Manager**: Detection accuracy 0.90, reporting probability 0.90. Extra task completion for delays if experienced (>0.7). Contribute to task and resource management.
- **Director**: Detection accuracy 0.85, reporting probability 0.85. Focus on escalation or action, reporting downward in functional structures.
- **Reporter**: Detection accuracy 0.95 with 1.5x modifier, reporting probability 0.95. Aggregate and broadcast reports in dedicated structures, enhancing SA_Level.
- **Decision Model**: Logistic regression predicts probabilities for `ignore`, `act`, `report`, `escalate` based on workload, fatigue, event severity, etc.

## Stochasticity

Stochasticity models uncertainty in:

- **Event Generation** (`construction_model.py`):
  - Hazards (base 0.01), delays (0.015), resource shortages (0.001), with probabilities adjusted by fatigue, budget, and incidents. Severities are random (e.g., 0.5–1.0 for hazards).
  - Hazards increase delay/resource shortage probabilities.
- **Agent Initialization**: Random workload (0–5), fatigue (0–1), experience (0–1), risk tolerance (0–1), and grid positions.
- **Decision-Making**: Random checks for event detection and reporting. Action selection uses random numbers against `DecisionModel` probabilities.
- **Communication**: Random communication failures and neighbor selection.
- **SA Updates** (updated in `construction_agent.py`):
  - Perception: `min(perception + detection_accuracy * 40 * (1 + experience) * org_sa_modifier * sa_reduction + np.random.normal(0, 5), 50)`
  - Comprehension: `min(comprehension + detection_accuracy * 30 * (1 + experience) * org_sa_modifier * sa_reduction + np.random.normal(0, 5), 50)`
  - Projection: `min(projection + detection_accuracy * 20 * (1 + experience) * org_sa_modifier * sa_reduction + np.random.normal(0, 5), 50)`
  - For Reporters: Use 50, 40, 30 as base increments due to 1.5x modifier.
  - The `np.random.normal(0, 5)` term adds stochastic noise, and the SA cap is 50 to prevent convergence.

## Decision Flows

Decision flows (`construction_agent.py`, `construction_model.py`):

1. **Event Generation**: Stochastic event creation each step.
2. **Observation**: Agents detect events, updating SA with stochastic noise, mediated by role and communication effectiveness.
3. **Action Decision**: Workers act on hazards; others use `DecisionModel`.
4. **Action Execution**: `ACT`, `REPORT`, or `ESCALATE` consume budget and update outcomes.
5. **Report Handling**: Reports sent/received based on reporting structure, with follow-up actions.
6. **Logging**: Metrics and SA data (Step 0 and Step 100 for SA_Level) saved to Excel/CSV.

## Impact of Organizational Structure in Dedicated Configuration

- **Functional**: Hierarchical reporting and Reporter aggregation enhance SA_Level. Moderate radius (3) and failure rate (0.05) balance efficiency.
- **Flat**: Larger radius (5) and lower failure rate (0.04) improve transmission but reduce coordination.
- **Hierarchical**: Smaller radius (2) and higher failure rate (0.06) hinder communication.

### Interpretation of Results

1. **Support for H1**:
   - The dedicated reporting structure achieves a higher SA_Level (47.60) than self (46.53) and none (46.25), supporting H1. The ANOVA (F=7.5914, p=0.0008) and Tukey HSD results confirm significant differences, with dedicated outperforming none (p=0.0008) and self (p=0.0109). No significant difference exists between self and none (p=0.7007).
   - The mean differences (1.0704–1.3536) are smaller than in the original results for Average_SA (16.0739–16.2742), reflecting the stochastic SA updates and lower SA cap (50), which introduce realistic variability while maintaining the dedicated structure’s advantage.

2. **Role of Variables**:
   - **Independent Variable (Reporting Structure)**: The dedicated structure’s higher SA_Level is driven by Reporters’ aggregation and broadcasting, which enhance communication effectiveness, a key mediating variable. Self and none structures, lacking dedicated Reporters, show lower SA_Level due to less efficient information flow.
   - **Dependent Variable (SA_Level)**: SA_Level captures the improvement in SA over the simulation, aligning with the hypothesis’s focus on SA growth. The equivalence of SA_Level and SA_Score (e.g., 56.88 for Reporters) suggests initial SA scores at Step 0 are near 0, which should be verified.
   - **Mediating Variables**:
     - **Agent Role**: Reporters’ high SA_Level (56.88, Std=18.93) in dedicated structures reflects their 1.5x detection modifier and aggregation role, mediating the effect of reporting structure on SA_Level.
     - **Communication Effectiveness**: Higher Reports_Received in dedicated structures (e.g., Managers=7.26 vs. 3.26 for self) enhances SA updates, increasing SA_Level. The none structure’s low Reports_Received for Workers (0.00) limits SA_Level (46.25).
     - **Event Detection and Reporting**: High detection accuracies (0.80–0.95) and reporting probabilities (0.80–0.95) ensure frequent SA updates, with stochastic noise (`np.random.normal(0, 5)`) adding variability.

3. **Impact of Stochastic SA Updates**:
   - **Increased Variance**: The standard deviations for Average_SA (1.43–1.68) and SA_Level by role (12.42–18.93) are higher than the original results (Std=1.12–1.37 for Average_SA), confirming that the `np.random.normal(0, 5)` term and SA cap of 50 increase variability. Reporters’ SA_Level (Std=18.93) shows significant stochastic variation.
   - **Effect Size Reduction**: The Cohen’s f (0.7390) is much lower than the original (11.1320), indicating a realistic effect size. The estimated 21 runs for adequate power (alpha=0.05, power=0.8) confirms that 26 runs are sufficient.
   - **SA_Level Values**: The equivalence of SA_Level and SA_Score suggests initial SA scores at Step 0 are near 0, requiring verification of Step 0 logging.

4. **Project Outcomes**:
   - **Safety_Incidents**: Similar across structures (48.58–49.35), as Workers’ mandatory hazard actions are unaffected by reporting structure.
   - **Total_Tasks**: Higher in dedicated (107.69) than self (96.65) and none (98.23), reflecting better coordination due to higher SA_Level.
   - **Schedule_Adherence**: Slightly lower in dedicated (89.57%) than self (91.38%) and none (90.07%), possibly due to stochastic SA variations affecting task prioritization. High Std (9.65 for self) indicates variability.

5. **Robustness**:
   - The increased variance (Std=1.43–1.68 for Average_SA, 12.42–18.93 for SA_Level) enhances robustness by reflecting real-world variability. The lower effect size (0.7390) and sufficient runs (26 > 21) ensure reliable statistical power.
   - The `SettingWithCopyWarning` in `analyse_h1.py` indicates a need for `.loc` to ensure data integrity.

### Implications

- **Support for H1**: The dedicated structure’s higher SA_Level (47.60) validates H1, driven by Reporters’ mediation of communication effectiveness. The smaller mean differences (1.0704–1.3536) reflect realistic variability from stochastic SA updates.
- **Practical Relevance**: Dedicated reporting roles (e.g., safety officers) enhance SA improvement in construction projects, improving coordination and task completion, though Schedule_Adherence suggests potential trade-offs.
- **Variance Improvement**: Stochastic SA updates address the original low variance issue, with higher standard deviations enhancing robustness and generalizability.
- **Limitations**:
  - The equivalence of SA_Level and SA_Score suggests initial SA scores at Step 0 are near 0, requiring verification of logging in `construction_model.py`.
  - High variance in Reporters’ SA_Level (Std=18.93) may indicate excessive noise; adjusting to `np.random.normal(0, 3)` could balance variability.
  - Fixed parameters (e.g., hazard_prob=0.01) may limit variance.

### Recommendations

1. **Verify Initial SA Logging**:
   - Ensure `log_agent_situational_awareness` in `construction_model.py` captures SA at Step 0. If initial SA is 0, clarify SA_Level calculation or initialize SA with random values (e.g., `np.random.uniform(0, 10)`).
2. **Fine-Tune Stochastic Noise**:
   - Test `np.random.normal(0, 3)` to reduce excessive variance in Reporters’ SA_Level (Std=18.93).
3. **Increase Parameter Variability**:
   - Randomize event probabilities (e.g., hazard_prob=0.005–0.015) or agent counts.
4. **Fix Pandas Warning**:
   - Update `analyse_h1.py`:
     ```python
     final_step.loc[:, col] = final_step[col].apply(clean_numeric_value)
     final_step.loc[:, "Average_SA"] = final_step[sa_columns].mean(axis=1, numeric_only=True)
     final_step.loc[:, "SA_Level"] = final_step["Average_SA"] - initial_step["Average_SA"].values
     ```
5. **Increase Runs**: Consider 50 runs to capture additional variability.

## Conclusion

The simulation, with stochastic SA updates (`np.random.normal(0, 5)` and SA cap=50), SA_Level as the dependent variable, and clearly defined independent (reporting structure) and mediating variables (agent role, communication effectiveness, event detection/reporting), confirms H1. The dedicated structure achieves higher SA_Level (47.60) than self (46.53) and none (46.25), driven by Reporters’ mediation. Increased variance (Std=1.43–1.68 for Average_SA, 12.42–18.93 for SA_Level) enhances robustness, with a realistic effect size (0.7390). Refinements to noise levels, initial SA logging, and parameter variability will further strengthen generalizability to real-world construction scenarios.
